GOALS:
    1. Create a Black Hole Simulation Vizualization
        a. This simulization should emulate the curvature of light
           in the presence of a Black Hole
        b. First we should try to do a 2D simulation then a 3D simulation
        c. Ideally we should be able to interact with the simulation while
           it is running
        d. Eventually we can expand the simulation to have different types
           of black holes (eg spinning or maybe charged)
    2. Learn OPENGL
        a. Really we could use any Vector Graphics API but I think it would be
           nice to just pick one and stick with it for now

GROUNDRULES:
    1. Program in C
        a. Mostly just out of preference and a desire for practice
    2. Keep the Main Branch clean
        a. If adding something make a feature branch first, work on that
           then merge it back in to main
    3. Try to have fun
        a. Nothing here is time sensitive so no need to rush anything

PLAN OF ACTION:
    1. Get OPENGL to render objects
    2. Get OPENGL to render arrays
    3. Add Update function to array points
    4. Model that update function to be physics based
    5. Make the physics to be for a BlackHole
    6. 2D Blackhole
    7. 3D Blackhole (fixed Perspective)
    8. Add ability to rotate Perspective

Note:
    1. PLAN OF ACTION will probably change and thats fine, some steps
       can be merged and we'll deal with that then
